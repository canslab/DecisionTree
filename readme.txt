- Introduction

Decision tree is one of the classification methods. However, the decision tree approach suffers due to several problems, such as overfitting and attribute selection problems. With a bagging method, I overcame these shortcomings. I developed this software using the C# language.
When given training data, this program constructs an ensemble composed of decision trees. The information gain is used. Once the test input file is processed, the result is given as a file called ‘dt_result.txt’.

- Instructions

1. There are some training examples in the ‘examples’ folder.

2. After you compile this project, you should designate training file as a first argument and test input file as a second argument.

3. Run! (If you didn’t do the second step, you would face an error)

- Format of training and test files
You will know the right format after you scrutinize example training and test files.
